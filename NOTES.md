## Tasks

- ✅ Creating with executor

- ✅ Normal `then`/`catch`/`finally` flow
- ✅ All handlers get an `abort` function parameter that aborts the rest of the chain
- ✅ Added test suite
- ✅ Add eslint & prettier
- ✅ Write readme
- use Promise.race instead of the timeout->done in the tests?
- Readme: side by side example
